STEPS TO RUN THE ASSIGNMENT

1. Change the directory to the root folder and run the server.js file with either the node or the nodemon command
   [Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed (ejs, npm, morgan, mongoose, etc.)]

   In order to test the API endpoints, you will need Postman. You can download it from the website or as an extension in VS code.

   Testing app with Postman:
   1. Open Postman: Launch Postman on your computer.
   2. Create a New Request: Click "New" in Postman to create a new request.
   3. Define Your API Endpoint: Specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL of your API endpoint. 
   4. Add necessary json body and send the request.
   5. Start by adding a category, then an event. remember the IDs generated. Next, head to addEventToCategory function and key in the IDs and send. 
      Now, list the categories and eventlist will be populated.

      Testing app with localhost:
1. Start server with node server.js

2. Go on your browser and enter "http://localhost:8080/" to access the homepage to the web application

3. Once on the home page (index.html), you are free to use the Event Management Application (EMA)

4. Make sure you add a category first before you add an event or wish to perform any other actions.

5. If you wish to add any other images for either an event or a category, make sure you add the (.png) to the Images folder before you
   use it on the web application

6. When you use the "category details page" or "delete event by id" function, make sure you add the ids in the url as a parameter by 
   adding "?id={id}" 
   
7. When using 'search by keyword' function, please key into the url '?id={id}'. 
   The button is set to find the keyword 'sample' initially.

8. If you use the 'show event details' button at homepage, please key into the url '?id={id}'.
